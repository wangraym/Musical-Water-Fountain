# Musical-Water-Fountain
Developed in the Winter of 2018 for MIE438 - Microprocessors and Embedded Microcontrollers course. The goal was to demonstrate Embedded Microcontroller concepts learned in class with a proof of concept.

We built a music water fountain that shoots water to the sound of music frequencies it detects from a microphone. Code is written in Arduino. Analog audio samples are filtered using a FFT library.
